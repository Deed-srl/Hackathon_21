<h1>Use case description</h1>
<p>According to Article 41 of the Italian Constitution, an employer has freedom of economic initiative, but this must be exercised in full respect of the freedom and dignity of its employees.
  The employer's power of control, therefore, finds its limits in respecting the privacy, personal dignity, freedom of expression and communication of workers.</p>

<h1>How we built it</h1>
<p>Using the technological standards of SSI, we give the employer the capability of complete control over their employees, guaranteeing the highest levels of privacy and personal dignity. 
  Thanks to the get™ wearable device, we make it possible to integrate and use SSI and VC within the world of industry 4.0.
  get ™ implements a decentralized key management system, container of all rights within the enterprise context. 
  Together with the wearable, our solution includes a company dashboard within which the employer is able to create and revoke employee verified credentials and monitor operations and accesses within the workplace in real time. In addition, thanks to the processors inside the get, the employer will also be able to monitor some vital parameters, always respecting privacy, to improve safety within the working environment.
  Finally, the wearable get ™ can easily connect with any intelligent machine thanks to NFC, BTBle and WiFfi connections.</p>

<h1>Market approach and follow up</h1>
<i>The get® solution thus proposed is made available to the Dizme ecosystem with an interoperability approach with factors and technologies that field new security factors in terms of authentication and data protection directly on board the device. Both in B2B and B2C there are advantages for implementations or integrations with direct user use or cross selling.

  To conclude, reference is made to further scenarios to validate the adaptability of the get ™ solution in areas such as:
  B2C
  Smart Cities, ES: metro turnstiles, sharing services where it is necessary to authenticate the customer / user and offer a payment service;
  B2B
  Industry 4.0: IoT> control> security> credential> access> use / maintenance;
  Employees or business consultants: for an authorized access control that grants permissions;
  Employees: access to work areas, employee health monitoring in compliance with privacy regulations;
  Banking: get ™ as a hard wallet for integrating both classic and token / crypto / complementary currency payment systems.</i>
